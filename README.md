# ðŸš€ Go-fullstack
This project marks my journey into fullstack development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It's my first hands-on experience with backend technologies, where I learned to set up Express.js, connect to a MongoDB database, and build a React frontend to interact with the backend.
# ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js (building interactive UI components)<br />
Backend: Node.js with Express.js (creating RESTful APIs<br />
Database: MongoDB (handling and storing data)<br />

# ðŸ”¹ Key Learnings:
âœ… Express.js: Setting up a server and creating API endpoints<br />
âœ… MongoDB: Connecting and interacting with the database to store and retrieve data<br />
âœ… React: Building dynamic components and managing frontend state<br />
âœ… Fullstack Development: Integrating the frontend and backend into a cohesive web application<br />

ðŸ’¡ Project Overview:
This project helped me grasp the core concepts of fullstack development, and it was an essential step in building my skills in modern web development.
