# Go-fullstack
This project marks my journey into fullstack development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It's my first hands-on experience with backend technologies, where I learned to set up Express.js, connect to a MongoDB database, and build a React frontend to interact with the backend.
